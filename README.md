# odin-recipes

A sample website that will be leveraged to learn more about HTML and the process of creating a website from scratch.
Things that I will be specifically mindful of:

- When to use commits
- When to push to the live environment

Best practics:

- Commit early and often.. over commit on this one and dial it back in the future
- Commit everytime there is a meaningful code change.. it will create a timeline of progress

Note: this project will be built upon in the future, so it's important to set a strong foundation.

Post project reflection:
Everything went well. Continue to focus on timing when adding files and committing. It is helpful to add one file at a time and
commit with a tailored message. It's easy to over-do this. For example, I probably did not need to add both the file creation
and the addition of ingredients / directions in seperate commits. It would've been better to do one and describe the contents of it.
